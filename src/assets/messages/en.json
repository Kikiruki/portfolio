I am mastering film photography at an accelerated pace. 365 days a year Iâ€™m a non-professional soccer player on my own soccer team, 24/7 make up jokes, and plan to become an Adidas ambassador in future.\n\nAlso I'm a junior+ creator. And now my focus is on developing and improving my skills, so I'm open to new interesting projects and challenges.\n\nFeel free to contact (all links are in my BIO)"
